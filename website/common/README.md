# Common

This will be the location of any shared code for our website interfaces in /admin, /student, and /company.

Best practice is to try put as much code here while it makes sense to be shared.

To use, basically import like so:

```javascript
import {SampleComponent} from '@website/common/components/SampleComponent';
```

Refer to [here](https://medium.com/frontend-digest/using-create-react-app-in-a-monorepo-a4e6f25be7aa) for a guide I followed on configuring this.
